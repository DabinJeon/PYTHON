It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.This film is way better than endgame!\\nThe actions better\\nThe writings better\\nThe dialogues better\\nThe cgi is better\\nMore shocks and more emotional.\\nWatching both in the cinema , the reactions to this in cinema was unbelievable compared to endgame. Dont get me wrong endgame is good but to say its the best marvel film is jus marvel fan boys being stupid.\\nI just dont see how people are saying endgame is the best marvel film when theres clearly other marvel films better than it!\\nBut trust me this is the film that changed the mcu , lol maybe it because i wanted them to lose because thanos is badass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..but still 10/10. Or 9.5 if its possible.The MCU has been very consistent in their filmmaking and I am happy that Infinity War absolutely delivers.\\nI am happy that it feels like and is a Thanos movie, a movie about a giant purple men who is here not because to kill smth but to fullfil his deep inner beliefs which is well written and understandable for the audience.\\nThe level of how well they combined so many important characters in one movie is immeasureable and still have the ability to craft a good story around it.This movie is not perfect. Jokes are sometimes heavily missplaced and Peter Quills occurence with Thanos at Titan is not well thought out. I wish there would be a better solution.Still. 10 years developement of a consistent franchise. And in the end a purple men with a not so empty heart wins. ITS GREAT.I consider myself a big comic book marvel fan. My favorite films from the franchise so far, are Cap. American: Winter Soldier and Thor: Ragnarok. As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations. I am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It\\'s not about power or dominance. It\\'s about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas. I agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can\\'t really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony. I give this movie my highest recommendations. It\\'s a must-see for anyone with just a remote interest in the franchise.This movie is the beginning of the culmination of Marvel\\'s masterfully woven cinematic universe. Beginning back in 2008 with iron man, we are finally seeing the results of all the movies have been pointing to; and it did not disappoint. Thanos is a complex villain, with deeper and more interesting desires than just \"world domination.\" The dilemmas all the characters face in this movie (both the heroes and the villains) are truly thought provoking and leave you on the edge of your seat. No other set of movies has beeen so involved, so expanded, and encompassed so many story lines/characters and previous movies. The sheer amount of star power alone in this film is insane; and they do a masterful job of weaving all these unique and various characters into a common storyline.Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they\\'ve helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel\\'s two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks. And yet, it\\'s perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that\\'s been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible. But that\\'s precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement. Masterfully directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Infinity War is bold, brainy filmmaking at its very best: the kind that will lift your spirits, blow your mind and shatter your soul - occasionally in the same scene. It demonstrates on an epic scale what Marvel has known all along: that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story. For all its blockbuster spectacle (and there\\'s almost too much of that), the film works because it\\'s anchored by the heart, humour and humanity of its characters.The film\\'s basic plot is simple: Thanos (played via motion-capture by Josh Brolin), intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction, has long been on the hunt for the six Infinity Stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe. He dispatches his acolytes to Earth to retrieve the Time Stone, currently in the possession of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and carve the Mind Stone out of the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany). It\\'s a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes we\\'ve come to know and love - from the Avengers to the Guardians of the Galaxy - must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe. From the outset, it\\'s immediately clear that neither the film\\'s directors nor screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are interested in playing it safe. Most other superhero films are bled of high stakes - the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma, but it\\'s a super-safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive. There\\'s no such guarantee here. Within the first ten minutes, we are confronted with the dark, twisted depths to which Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order will sink in order to achieve their goals. Death, as well as genuine loss and sacrifice, is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives Infinity War ever forward, and the film is all the better for it. That\\'s not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience. What\\'s so impressive about Infinity War is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods. When it\\'s funny (and it very often is), it\\'s deeply, truly funny. The film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon, mixing and matching ones you\\'d never have expected to share scenes or trade banter. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is floored by Thor\\'s (Chris Hemsworth) godly muscles. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is charmed by the wit and intelligence of Shuri (Letitia Wright). And it\\'d be impossible to not be utterly delighted by Peter Dinklage\\'s inspired cameo. It\\'s a blithely tongue-in-cheek sensibility shared by Marvel\\'s best comic books, which understand that humour can make you care when it really counts.And, boy, does Infinity War make it count. There are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film: from the charming surrogate father-son dynamic shared by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to the undeniable love that ties Vision and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) together. In many ways, the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love, but to love fiercely and beyond all logic. It\\'s right there when the unfailingly noble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) declares, \"We don\\'t trade lives\", even when giving up one could save billions. There\\'s even a chilling echo of it in Thanos himself. A lesser film would have turned Thanos into a one-dimensional villain, much the way he\\'s all monster and maniac in the comic books. In Infinity War, however, Thanos\\' end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today. There is, as it turns out, method to Thanos\\' madness. It makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), all the more unsettling. For the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle\\'s James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight. Even so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey\\'s film. He plays every note of Tony\\'s reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he\\'s convinced is a suicide mission. He\\'s ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character\\'s most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe.In a film with so many moving parts, some elements don\\'t work quite as well. A couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront - including an original Avenger or two - fade into the background. The film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene, and while most of them are fantastically choreographed, there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent Thanos from clenching his fist. In effect, this is a superhero mêlée that\\'s part over-the-top and part overkill, and might prove too much for those who don\\'t already care for this franchise and the characters in it.Minor quibbles aside, though, Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio\\'s tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It\\'s a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you\\'ll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next.Summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like \"epic\", \"spectacle\", and \"smash\" as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales.\\nThe summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\\nWhen Thanos (Josh Brolin), embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the Infinity Stones, he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path. When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive.\\nWith The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of \"Captain America: Civil War\" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing.\\nNaturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence.\\nWhat really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other.\\nThere are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film.\\nI was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene.\\nBelieve the hype, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be.\\n5 stars out of 5I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please. This movie was 2 1/2 hours long, but I could have sat there another 2 1/2 hours and not noticed. Thoroughly entertaining, and I love how the directors weren\\'t afraid to take chances. I\\'ve read a lot of other user reviews that claim that there\\'s no plot. Unless you\\'re mentally handicapped or not paying attention because you\\'re on your phone the entire movie, the plot is pretty clear, and decent in my opinion.Best movie Avengers infinity war 2018 I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please.

I\\'ve read a lot of other user reviews that claim that there\\'s no plot. Unless you\\'re mentally handicapped or not paying attention because you\\'re on your phone the entire movie, the plot is pretty clear, and decent in my opinion.Infinity War does a brilliant job by seamlessly combining the last few films together. It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians. He interrogates Thor and beats Hulk so bad he is too scared to ever turn green again. A defeated Hulk/Bruce Banner is then transported to Doctor Strange\\'s Sanctum Sanctorum so he can warn him of Thanos\\' arrival. It is down to Doctor Strange, Wong, Tony Stark and Spider Man to prevent Thanos\\' evil minions from destroying New York and taking the time stone. It\\'s a thrilling action sequence that introduces Starks cool new nano-bot armour that creates its own swords and shields. Thanos has been teased since 2012 and the wait has paid off here as he is by far one of the best villains. The story is more about him achieving his goals which is refreshing to see as the villains are normally sidelined in these films. He is so determined to get all six gems, each gem making him stronger. The Avengers and Guardians have to race against time to stop him from finding all six. One sequence on his home planet \\'Titan\\' is worth mentioning and like most of the film, it is breathtaking and tense. His crew (Dark Order) also seem unbeatable as they battle the rest of the Avengers in Wakanda with their alien army which also proves difficult. Thanos gets some interesting backstory, it would have been even better if the menacing Dark Order got some backstory themselves as we never really understand them or their motivations.Even though it enters familiar ground, it is often done differently and most of the time it\\'s unpredictable. It\\'s full of surprises and twists which will leave you exhausted by the end. Although Infinity War feels over stuffed with characters and storylines, the Russo Brothers do an exceptional job by giving each character enough to do. Its great to see some focus on characters like Gamora and Thor as previous films have kept it prominently on characters Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. That\\'s not to say they don\\'t get anything to do because they do, it\\'s just not as much as usual. This entry really does require you to see all of the ones before it as it can become confusing. They often call back to previous events and storylines, so it\\'s a better experience if you are familiar with all of them. There are also so many fun references like Rocket Racoon\\'s need for artificial limbs, Thor\\'s new haircut and Drax\\'s constant quips. There are too many visual effects shots which could have been avoided using practical effects. The CGI shots don\\'t look bad, but sometimes they can be distracting. However it\\'s a technique that is quicker than any other, and with studio films of this scale that\\'s just a small price to pay. The action scenes are so well directed accompanied by a music score by Alan Silvestri who always adds that extra level of excitement to them. It is a relief to say Infinity War runs well over 2 hours 30 minutes which is the longest Marvel film. There is no point saying its \"baggy\" or \"overlong\" as fans of the franchise will greatly appreciate this and with so much going on the runtime is justified.All the reviews that say this movie has no plot are either trolls, idiots, or didn\\'t are to take the time to watch previous marvel movies. Every single one of those ratings and reviews should be taken down and not added to the rating for Infinity War because of their fundamental lack of understanding. It\\'s like coming in and watching the last 2 minutes of an hour long drama show and saying this episode sucks because it has no plot. It\\'s utterly ridiculous!There have been 31 marvel movies leading up to this point. All 31 has have some plot that leads to infinity war. Infinity War IS the end game movie. There is nothing left to explain, nothing left to discuss, it is all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. There have been 31 movies to explain in someway the power of these stones and/or the heroes that come together to fight Thanos in this movie. It\\'s like a long game of chess where Thanos finally makes his move, and it\\'s a huge one.So I beg of any of you who reads this. Don\\'t listen to anyone who says this movie has no plot, has no reason and is only fighting. They aren\\'t worth listening to, Infinity Wars has roughly 60 hours of plot from 31 precious movies leading up to this monumental fight for life or death, and the movie is done to near perfection. The movie is glorious, the CGI is fantastic, the battles are awe-inspiring, and Thanos is made worth of your fear from the very beginning. He is truly the Mad Titan that captures your heart and crushes it right in front of your eyes. Anyone who doesn\\'t think this clearly didn\\'t see the same movie.With the beggining of the movie it was full of surpises. \\nWhat I really liked in the movie was the serious tone and the real threat hanging over the Avengers. Yes...this is THANOS ! He is an amazing villain ! \\nMARVEL Studious show us once again that their production are spectacular visual!I absolutely loved this movie. It was intense, action-packed and emotional. Also delivering comedy when needed, but it was a relatively dark film. All of the actors delivered great performances and the characters continue to be fleshed out and be made human despite the fact that they\\'re superheroes. This is easily the best superhero movie ever made. Thanos is one of the best villains of the MCU, as well as one of the best of Cinematic history in general. Upon first viewing, I hated him, but found his character intriguing. Similar to Emperor Palpatine in the Original and Prequel trilogies of Star Wars. The more times I rewatch it though, I start to understand Thanos\\' point of view more and more. The blurred lines with his motivations make the movie more compelling. Even driving some people to say that Thanos was right in all this. I wouldn\\'t go that far, but I would say his character is misunderstood. Definitely a compelling villain in Thanos. The ending of the movie was insanely emotional, but I love how they (mainly) set aside the original Avengers team to take on Thanos in the fourth Avengers movie. I, for one, cannot wait.That eerie \"Thanos will return\" at the end of the film sent a chill down my spine. It truly is the end game now, and I can\\'t wait to see the Avengers rise up and likely defeat Thanos in the next movie.+Every Hero has their moment to shine (Much like the villain wants, the movie achieves balance in this way)\\n+Good Comedic moments to balance (again pun intended) the dark tone of the film\\n+Emotional and Heavy ending (Seeing Earths Mightiest fail is something devastating to watch)\\n+Complete hype moments that reward you for being a fan of this franchise for 10 years\\n+Incredible performances\\n+Phenomenal original score \\nEtc. Not much you can find that\\'s wrong with this movie. It\\'s literally the perfect movie Marvel has been building up to for 10 years. And those that claim it didn\\'t have an ending as a negative, I beg to differ. Just because the villain won doesn\\'t mean it didn\\'t have an ending. My Rating: 10/10Long behold, the film everyone has been waiting ten years for, is finally here! This is one of those Marvel films that anyone can enjoy, while the Russo Brothers also brilliantly utilizes all that we\\'ve learned in the past MCU films, to create the most cohesive, emotional, and high octane, story yet! The Russo Brothers utilized some of the best tones the MCU has set, to really enhance the emotion and tention in every scene. They put a great deal of heart into this film, but sometimes it got cut thin by the over abundance of jokes, that Marvel seems to think is necessary, every opportunity there is. The Russo Brothers had both hands on the wheel at all times, setting this fast, yet brisk pace, incorporating countless memorable scenes! There wasn\\'t a scene that goes under appreciated, adding in tremendous risk, from the most menacing villain yet, but at times, it can feel a little clunky with the scene placement.With this still being a story-based film, the characters moved the story really well, being the driving force of the film! While having all of these characters on screen at once, it\\'s impossible to balance everyone equally, but the Russo Brothers were able to create so many amazing character moments, to get you really invested into what\\'s going on, and not so much, what they missed. Even though they can step on their own toes at times, creating some inconsistencies and plot gaps, they still did a good job of understanding where these characters come from, and used them to their strengths. The cast as a whole does a great job, displaying seamless chemistry, even from some of the side and new characters.The screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, was very good overall. There are a lot more high points to the writing than bad, but there are still some forceful pieces of dialogue and jokes at times. Markus and McFeely have had their hands in most of these films, creating some hit or miss screenplays, but they put on their best work here.So far, Infinity War undoubtedly has the best action sequences of the saga. The Russo Brothers crafted so many high octane action scenes, backed up by some amazing stunt work. The effects were done pretty well for the most part, but there are some points where you can tell they got lazy, and didn\\'t completely polish things up as well as they could\\'ve.Overall, Infinity War is THE BEST film of the Infinity Saga, bringing these films to new heights!Infinity War had a lot to offer with stunning cgi that basically made the entire film apart from the heroes heads animated but done so well it looks real. The adventure the quest the ultimate event, and over ten years of waiting for the MCU to finish. Thanos really makes you question your morals... if you\\'re twelve years old and don\\'t understand the myth of overpopulation and genocidal tactics. The action and heros are a welcome inclusion and yeah this movie was kicka**. Not as good as Endgame but close.By far the best marvel film, it is so good. The most emotional marvel film to date. The battle is the best part and the parts after the battle are very emotional and after 1st time watching you really want to know what\\'s going to happen and gets you thinking a lot. The acting is solid, visual effects are great, definitely a 10/10 especially for a marvel film.A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level.\\nIn a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second.\\nIt is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop.\\n\\'Avengers Infinity War\\' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.10 Years of Build Up wasn\\'t wasted on this Movie. Infinity War is one of the greatest movies of all time because of how carefully they set everything else up. Stellar character growth and an incredible story make this stand out amongst the rest of Marvel. Thanos is one of the Greatest Movie Villains of all time due to the handling of his character. Everything from the beginning filled with dread of what\\'s To come to the ending where they fulfilled their promise of dread was done perfectly. Infinity War is one of the best action movies ever made.I believe that Avengers : Infinity War is without a doubt the pinnacle of blockbuster entertainment (along with its sequel). Nothing quite like it has been attempted before ; and it may take a while for anything to surpass that.To this date, it is my favorite theater experience of all time. I watched it opening weekend, managed to avoid all the spoilers and contained my excitement as best as I could in the previous days. Then, the movie made me laugh, sent chills down my spine and left me shocked by the time the credits rolled. It might not be the most creative or artistic movie out there, but there is no doubt to me that it\\'s one of the most entertaining. There is not a second of downtime during its two hours-and-a-half. Every character is given its time to shine. It is simply A-W-E-S-O-M-E.Personally, I have to agree with Martin Scorsese when it comes to Infinity War. You simply can\\'t call this thing a movie.In reality, it is much more than that.I would call it a cultural phenomenon.Avengers Infinity War is a truly great film. The actors pour their hearts out into every scene and the story is brilliant bringing lots of great twists and turns! The cinematography in this movie is beautiful making it visually stunning. The characters are also very interesting and you care about most of them. I recommend this Avengers film.Easily the best Avengers film to date. It is refreshing to see our heroes lose for once. Who knew that Marvel would actually put real stakes for the Avengers to deal with into one of their films?If I may blatantly objectify someone for a moment, bearded Chris Evans is the best Chris Evans :-)I have to say that the \"I don\\'t want to go!\" scene between Peter and Tony got me right in the feels.Thanos is the most powerful, he always defeats all the heroes, (but they always like his action) and we only see (thanos is in wakanda and killing Vision).\\nIt will be that the stones are entangled in various scenarios; that they are not well, by the power of thanos (when it was the snap), and that the heroes solve the revenge.Avengers infinity war is a masterpiece in every way with an amazing story that is never boring, phenomenal action that\\'s intense but also a lot of fun, amazing acting (stand outs are Robert Downey jr, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pratt, and josh brolin), fantastic visuals, lovable and interesting characters, a great villain with thanos, hilarious comedy, gut wrenching moments, and a shocking ending. Watch it immediately.Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E\\'s that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. \\nSo let\\'s start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it\\'s highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). \\nNow, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you\\'ve seen in the previous marvel movies that aren\\'t dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it\\'s the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. \\nAnd of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel\\'s villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he\\'s got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. \\nI cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you\\'re a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what\\'s to come. I may be bias once again but I just have to. I have to rate this movie 10/10. If I don\\'t, I would be betraying myself.I went and looked, and I want to express my thoughts.I went to this film with very high expectations, with a sense of something. I went to him twice, the first time, myself, and the second with the family, and I was even surprised that my mother, sister and dad (who do not understand this movie at all) brought unreal pleasure and an ocean of emotions.Each frame, each scene does not let you get bored, from the Marvel logo, and to the stage after the credits. Favorite heroes once again experienced side by side and you feel it, you are completely absorbed in a hurricane of events and you are watching it in one breath. In comparison with the War of Infinity, even the Confrontation looks like an ordinary fight in the sandbox.Uuuu, and the villain, the best as for me the best in this kirovoveselennoy, he is not just a bot at once, without motivation, no, it\\'s just the opposite. I liked Thanos so much that you do not want to, and he began to impress me, in terms of his convictions (I had it only once, with Joker Heath Ledger). He has feelings, he makes choices, he\\'s alive.Tense scenes are beautiful, in one moment I still let off a meager male tear (and this happens to me very, very rarely). What about the humor, the jokes are correct for me, and they do not bother you like Thor: Ragnarok, although in the beginning they look a little tight. Well, the action, it is very high-quality, and in comparison with the Black Panther is generally ideal.And of course the film can not be without punctures. The lack of predictability of some story lines, and a couple of moments that were very predictable, but they are fade against the background of all this scale.Yes, you will not find anything in this film about something, something, but, what, what, what, steep humor. Thanks to Marvel and of course the Rousseau brothers, the beautiful actors and the wonderful movie that I\\'ve been waiting for for 3 years.Out of 10, I give the War of Infinity 9.This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.This film is way better than endgame!\\nThe actions better\\nThe writings better\\nThe dialogues better\\nThe cgi is better\\nMore shocks and more emotional.\\nWatching both in the cinema , the reactions to this in cinema was unbelievable compared to endgame. Dont get me wrong endgame is good but to say its the best marvel film is jus marvel fan boys being stupid.\\nI just dont see how people are saying endgame is the best marvel film when theres clearly other marvel films better than it!\\nBut trust me this is the film that changed the mcu , lol maybe it because i wanted them to lose because thanos is badass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..but still 10/10. Or 9.5 if its possible.The MCU has been very consistent in their filmmaking and I am happy that Infinity War absolutely delivers.\\nI am happy that it feels like and is a Thanos movie, a movie about a giant purple men who is here not because to kill smth but to fullfil his deep inner beliefs which is well written and understandable for the audience.\\nThe level of how well they combined so many important characters in one movie is immeasureable and still have the ability to craft a good story around it.This movie is not perfect. Jokes are sometimes heavily missplaced and Peter Quills occurence with Thanos at Titan is not well thought out. I wish there would be a better solution.Still. 10 years developement of a consistent franchise. And in the end a purple men with a not so empty heart wins. ITS GREAT.I consider myself a big comic book marvel fan. My favorite films from the franchise so far, are Cap. American: Winter Soldier and Thor: Ragnarok. As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations. I am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It\\'s not about power or dominance. It\\'s about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas. I agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can\\'t really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony. I give this movie my highest recommendations. It\\'s a must-see for anyone with just a remote interest in the franchise.This movie is the beginning of the culmination of Marvel\\'s masterfully woven cinematic universe. Beginning back in 2008 with iron man, we are finally seeing the results of all the movies have been pointing to; and it did not disappoint. Thanos is a complex villain, with deeper and more interesting desires than just \"world domination.\" The dilemmas all the characters face in this movie (both the heroes and the villains) are truly thought provoking and leave you on the edge of your seat. No other set of movies has beeen so involved, so expanded, and encompassed so many story lines/characters and previous movies. The sheer amount of star power alone in this film is insane; and they do a masterful job of weaving all these unique and various characters into a common storyline.Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they\\'ve helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel\\'s two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks. And yet, it\\'s perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that\\'s been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible. But that\\'s precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement. Masterfully directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Infinity War is bold, brainy filmmaking at its very best: the kind that will lift your spirits, blow your mind and shatter your soul - occasionally in the same scene. It demonstrates on an epic scale what Marvel has known all along: that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story. For all its blockbuster spectacle (and there\\'s almost too much of that), the film works because it\\'s anchored by the heart, humour and humanity of its characters.The film\\'s basic plot is simple: Thanos (played via motion-capture by Josh Brolin), intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction, has long been on the hunt for the six Infinity Stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe. He dispatches his acolytes to Earth to retrieve the Time Stone, currently in the possession of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and carve the Mind Stone out of the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany). It\\'s a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes we\\'ve come to know and love - from the Avengers to the Guardians of the Galaxy - must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe. From the outset, it\\'s immediately clear that neither the film\\'s directors nor screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are interested in playing it safe. Most other superhero films are bled of high stakes - the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma, but it\\'s a super-safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive. There\\'s no such guarantee here. Within the first ten minutes, we are confronted with the dark, twisted depths to which Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order will sink in order to achieve their goals. Death, as well as genuine loss and sacrifice, is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives Infinity War ever forward, and the film is all the better for it. That\\'s not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience. What\\'s so impressive about Infinity War is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods. When it\\'s funny (and it very often is), it\\'s deeply, truly funny. The film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon, mixing and matching ones you\\'d never have expected to share scenes or trade banter. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is floored by Thor\\'s (Chris Hemsworth) godly muscles. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is charmed by the wit and intelligence of Shuri (Letitia Wright). And it\\'d be impossible to not be utterly delighted by Peter Dinklage\\'s inspired cameo. It\\'s a blithely tongue-in-cheek sensibility shared by Marvel\\'s best comic books, which understand that humour can make you care when it really counts.And, boy, does Infinity War make it count. There are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film: from the charming surrogate father-son dynamic shared by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to the undeniable love that ties Vision and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) together. In many ways, the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love, but to love fiercely and beyond all logic. It\\'s right there when the unfailingly noble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) declares, \"We don\\'t trade lives\", even when giving up one could save billions. There\\'s even a chilling echo of it in Thanos himself. A lesser film would have turned Thanos into a one-dimensional villain, much the way he\\'s all monster and maniac in the comic books. In Infinity War, however, Thanos\\' end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today. There is, as it turns out, method to Thanos\\' madness. It makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), all the more unsettling. For the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle\\'s James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight. Even so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey\\'s film. He plays every note of Tony\\'s reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he\\'s convinced is a suicide mission. He\\'s ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character\\'s most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe.In a film with so many moving parts, some elements don\\'t work quite as well. A couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront - including an original Avenger or two - fade into the background. The film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene, and while most of them are fantastically choreographed, there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent Thanos from clenching his fist. In effect, this is a superhero mêlée that\\'s part over-the-top and part overkill, and might prove too much for those who don\\'t already care for this franchise and the characters in it.Minor quibbles aside, though, Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio\\'s tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It\\'s a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you\\'ll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next.Summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like \"epic\", \"spectacle\", and \"smash\" as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales.\\nThe summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\\nWhen Thanos (Josh Brolin), embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the Infinity Stones, he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path. When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive.\\nWith The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of \"Captain America: Civil War\" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing.\\nNaturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence.\\nWhat really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other.\\nThere are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film.\\nI was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene.\\nBelieve the hype, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be.\\n5 stars out of 5I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please. This movie was 2 1/2 hours long, but I could have sat there another 2 1/2 hours and not noticed. Thoroughly entertaining, and I love how the directors weren\\'t afraid to take chances. I\\'ve read a lot of other user reviews that claim that there\\'s no plot. Unless you\\'re mentally handicapped or not paying attention because you\\'re on your phone the entire movie, the plot is pretty clear, and decent in my opinion.Best movie Avengers infinity war 2018 I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please.

It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians. He interrogates Thor and beats Hulk so bad he is too scared to ever turn green again. A defeated Hulk/Bruce Banner is then transported to Doctor Strange\\'s Sanctum Sanctorum so he can warn him of Thanos\\' arrival. It is down to Doctor Strange, Wong, Tony Stark and Spider Man to prevent Thanos\\' evil minions from destroying New York and taking the time stone. It\\'s a thrilling action sequence that introduces Starks cool new nano-bot armour that creates its own swords and shields. Thanos has been teased since 2012 and the wait has paid off here as he is by far one of the best villains. The story is more about him achieving his goals which is refreshing to see as the villains are normally sidelined in these films. He is so determined to get all six gems, each gem making him stronger. The Avengers and Guardians have to race against time to stop him from finding all six. One sequence on his home planet \\'Titan\\' is worth mentioning and like most of the film, it is breathtaking and tense. His crew (Dark Order) also seem unbeatable as they battle the rest of the Avengers in Wakanda with their alien army which also proves difficult. Thanos gets some interesting backstory, it would have been even better if the menacing Dark Order got some backstory themselves as we never really understand them or their motivations.Even though it enters familiar ground, it is often done differently and most of the time it\\'s unpredictable. It\\'s full of surprises and twists which will leave you exhausted by the end. Although Infinity War feels over stuffed with characters and storylines, the Russo Brothers do an exceptional job by giving each character enough to do. Its great to see some focus on characters like Gamora and Thor as previous films have kept it prominently on characters Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. That\\'s not to say they don\\'t get anything to do because they do, it\\'s just not as much as usual. This entry really does require you to see all of the ones before it as it can become confusing. They often call back to previous events and storylines, so it\\'s a better experience if you are familiar with all of them. There are also so many fun references like Rocket Racoon\\'s need for artificial limbs, Thor\\'s new haircut and Drax\\'s constant quips. There are too many visual effects shots which could have been avoided using practical effects. The CGI shots don\\'t look bad, but sometimes they can be distracting. However it\\'s a technique that is quicker than any other, and with studio films of this scale that\\'s just a small price to pay. The action scenes are so well directed accompanied by a music score by Alan Silvestri who always adds that extra level of excitement to them. It is a relief to say Infinity War runs well over 2 hours 30 minutes which is the longest Marvel film. There is no point saying its \"baggy\" or \"overlong\" as fans of the franchise will greatly appreciate this and with so much going on the runtime is justified.All the reviews that say this movie has no plot are either trolls, idiots, or didn\\'t are to take the time to watch previous marvel movies. Every single one of those ratings and reviews should be taken down and not added to the rating for Infinity War because of their fundamental lack of understanding. It\\'s like coming in and watching the last 2 minutes of an hour long drama show and saying this episode sucks because it has no plot. It\\'s utterly ridiculous!There have been 31 marvel movies leading up to this point. All 31 has have some plot that leads to infinity war. Infinity War IS the end game movie. There is nothing left to explain, nothing left to discuss, it is all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. There have been 31 movies to explain in someway the power of these stones and/or the heroes that come together to fight Thanos in this movie. It\\'s like a long game of chess where Thanos finally makes his move, and it\\'s a huge one.So I beg of any of you who reads this. Don\\'t listen to anyone who says this movie has no plot, has no reason and is only fighting. They aren\\'t worth listening to, Infinity Wars has roughly 60 hours of plot from 31 precious movies leading up to this monumental fight for life or death, and the movie is done to near perfection. The movie is glorious, the CGI is fantastic, the battles are awe-inspiring, and Thanos is made worth of your fear from the very beginning. He is truly the Mad Titan that captures your heart and crushes it right in front of your eyes. Anyone who doesn\\'t think this clearly didn\\'t see the same movie.With the beggining of the movie it was full of surpises. \\nWhat I really liked in the movie was the serious tone and the real threat hanging over the Avengers. Yes...this is THANOS ! He is an amazing villain ! \\nMARVEL Studious show us once again that their production are spectacular visual!I absolutely loved this movie. It was intense, action-packed and emotional. Also delivering comedy when needed, but it was a relatively dark film. All of the actors delivered great performances and the characters continue to be fleshed out and be made human despite the fact that they\\'re superheroes. This is easily the best superhero movie ever made. Thanos is one of the best villains of the MCU, as well as one of the best of Cinematic history in general. Upon first viewing, I hated him, but found his character intriguing. Similar to Emperor Palpatine in the Original and Prequel trilogies of Star Wars. The more times I rewatch it though, I start to understand Thanos\\' point of view more and more. The blurred lines with his motivations make the movie more compelling. Even driving some people to say that Thanos was right in all this. I wouldn\\'t go that far, but I would say his character is misunderstood. Definitely a compelling villain in Thanos. The ending of the movie was insanely emotional, but I love how they (mainly) set aside the original Avengers team to take on Thanos in the fourth Avengers movie. I, for one, cannot wait.That eerie \"Thanos will return\" at the end of the film sent a chill down my spine. It truly is the end game now, and I can\\'t wait to see the Avengers rise up and likely defeat Thanos in the next movie.+Every Hero has their moment to shine (Much like the villain wants, the movie achieves balance in this way)\\n+Good Comedic moments to balance (again pun intended) the dark tone of the film\\n+Emotional and Heavy ending (Seeing Earths Mightiest fail is something devastating to watch)\\n+Complete hype moments that reward you for being a fan of this franchise for 10 years\\n+Incredible performances\\n+Phenomenal original score \\nEtc. Not much you can find that\\'s wrong with this movie. It\\'s literally the perfect movie Marvel has been building up to for 10 years. And those that claim it didn\\'t have an ending as a negative, I beg to differ. Just because the villain won doesn\\'t mean it didn\\'t have an ending. My Rating: 10/10Long behold, the film everyone has been waiting ten years for, is finally here! This is one of those Marvel films that anyone can enjoy, while the Russo Brothers also brilliantly utilizes all that we\\'ve learned in the past MCU films, to create the most cohesive, emotional, and high octane, story yet! The Russo Brothers utilized some of the best tones the MCU has set, to really enhance the emotion and tention in every scene. They put a great deal of heart into this film, but sometimes it got cut thin by the over abundance of jokes, that Marvel seems to think is necessary, every opportunity there is. The Russo Brothers had both hands on the wheel at all times, setting this fast, yet brisk pace, incorporating countless memorable scenes! There wasn\\'t a scene that goes under appreciated, adding in tremendous risk, from the most menacing villain yet, but at times, it can feel a little clunky with the scene placement.With this still being a story-based film, the characters moved the story really well, being the driving force of the film! While having all of these characters on screen at once, it\\'s impossible to balance everyone equally, but the Russo Brothers were able to create so many amazing character moments, to get you really invested into what\\'s going on, and not so much, what they missed. Even though they can step on their own toes at times, creating some inconsistencies and plot gaps, they still did a good job of understanding where these characters come from, and used them to their strengths. The cast as a whole does a great job, displaying seamless chemistry, even from some of the side and new characters.The screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, was very good overall. There are a lot more high points to the writing than bad, but there are still some forceful pieces of dialogue and jokes at times. Markus and McFeely have had their hands in most of these films, creating some hit or miss screenplays, but they put on their best work here.So far, Infinity War undoubtedly has the best action sequences of the saga. The Russo Brothers crafted so many high octane action scenes, backed up by some amazing stunt work. The effects were done pretty well for the most part, but there are some points where you can tell they got lazy, and didn\\'t completely polish things up as well as they could\\'ve.Overall, Infinity War is THE BEST film of the Infinity Saga, bringing these films to new heights!Infinity War had a lot to offer with stunning cgi that basically made the entire film apart from the heroes heads animated but done so well it looks real. The adventure the quest the ultimate event, and over ten years of waiting for the MCU to finish. Thanos really makes you question your morals... if you\\'re twelve years old and don\\'t understand the myth of overpopulation and genocidal tactics. The action and heros are a welcome inclusion and yeah this movie was kicka**. Not as good as Endgame but close.By far the best marvel film, it is so good. The most emotional marvel film to date. The battle is the best part and the parts after the battle are very emotional and after 1st time watching you really want to know what\\'s going to happen and gets you thinking a lot. The acting is solid, visual effects are great, definitely a 10/10 especially for a marvel film.A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level.\\nIn a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second.\\nIt is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop.\\n\\'Avengers Infinity War\\' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.10 Years of Build Up wasn\\'t wasted on this Movie. Infinity War is one of the greatest movies of all time because of how carefully they set everything else up. Stellar character growth and an incredible story make this stand out amongst the rest of Marvel. Thanos is one of the Greatest Movie Villains of all time due to the handling of his character. Everything from the beginning filled with dread of what\\'s To come to the ending where they fulfilled their promise of dread was done perfectly. Infinity War is one of the best action movies ever made.I believe that Avengers : Infinity War is without a doubt the pinnacle of blockbuster entertainment (along with its sequel). Nothing quite like it has been attempted before ; and it may take a while for anything to surpass that.To this date, it is my favorite theater experience of all time. I watched it opening weekend, managed to avoid all the spoilers and contained my excitement as best as I could in the previous days. Then, the movie made me laugh, sent chills down my spine and left me shocked by the time the credits rolled. It might not be the most creative or artistic movie out there, but there is no doubt to me that it\\'s one of the most entertaining. There is not a second of downtime during its two hours-and-a-half. Every character is given its time to shine. It is simply A-W-E-S-O-M-E.Personally, I have to agree with Martin Scorsese when it comes to Infinity War. You simply can\\'t call this thing a movie.In reality, it is much more than that.I would call it a cultural phenomenon.Avengers Infinity War is a truly great film. The actors pour their hearts out into every scene and the story is brilliant bringing lots of great twists and turns! The cinematography in this movie is beautiful making it visually stunning. The characters are also very interesting and you care about most of them. I recommend this Avengers film.Easily the best Avengers film to date. It is refreshing to see our heroes lose for once. Who knew that Marvel would actually put real stakes for the Avengers to deal with into one of their films?If I may blatantly objectify someone for a moment, bearded Chris Evans is the best Chris Evans :-)I have to say that the \"I don\\'t want to go!\" scene between Peter and Tony got me right in the feels.Thanos is the most powerful, he always defeats all the heroes, (but they always like his action) and we only see (thanos is in wakanda and killing Vision).\\nIt will be that the stones are entangled in various scenarios; that they are not well, by the power of thanos (when it was the snap), and that the heroes solve the revenge.Avengers infinity war is a masterpiece in every way with an amazing story that is never boring, phenomenal action that\\'s intense but also a lot of fun, amazing acting (stand outs are Robert Downey jr, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pratt, and josh brolin), fantastic visuals, lovable and interesting characters, a great villain with thanos, hilarious comedy, gut wrenching moments, and a shocking ending. Watch it immediately.Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E\\'s that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. \\nSo let\\'s start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it\\'s highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). \\nNow, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you\\'ve seen in the previous marvel movies that aren\\'t dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it\\'s the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. \\nAnd of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel\\'s villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he\\'s got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. \\nI cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you\\'re a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what\\'s to come. I may be bias once again but I just have to. I have to rate this movie 10/10. If I don\\'t, I would be betraying myself.I went and looked, and I want to express my thoughts.I went to this film with very high expectations, with a sense of something. I went to him twice, the first time, myself, and the second with the family, and I was even surprised that my mother, sister and dad (who do not understand this movie at all) brought unreal pleasure and an ocean of emotions.Each frame, each scene does not let you get bored, from the Marvel logo, and to the stage after the credits. Favorite heroes once again experienced side by side and you feel it, you are completely absorbed in a hurricane of events and you are watching it in one breath. In comparison with the War of Infinity, even the Confrontation looks like an ordinary fight in the sandbox.Uuuu, and the villain, the best as for me the best in this kirovoveselennoy, he is not just a bot at once, without motivation, no, it\\'s just the opposite. I liked Thanos so much that you do not want to, and he began to impress me, in terms of his convictions (I had it only once, with Joker Heath Ledger). He has feelings, he makes choices, he\\'s alive.Tense scenes are beautiful, in one moment I still let off a meager male tear (and this happens to me very, very rarely). What about the humor, the jokes are correct for me, and they do not bother you like Thor: Ragnarok, although in the beginning they look a little tight. Well, the action, it is very high-quality, and in comparison with the Black Panther is generally ideal.And of course the film can not be without punctures. The lack of predictability of some story lines, and a couple of moments that were very predictable, but they are fade against the background of all this scale.Yes, you will not find anything in this film about something, something, but, what, what, what, steep humor. Thanks to Marvel and of course the Rousseau brothers, the beautiful actors and the wonderful movie that I\\'ve been waiting for for 3 years.Out of 10, I give the War of Infinity 9.This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists.

Dont get me wrong endgame is good but to say its the best marvel film is jus marvel fan boys being stupid.\\nI just dont see how people are saying endgame is the best marvel film when theres clearly other marvel films better than it!\\nBut trust me this is the film that changed the mcu , lol maybe it because i wanted them to lose because thanos is badass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..but still 10/10. Or 9.5 if its possible.The MCU has been very consistent in their filmmaking and I am happy that Infinity War absolutely delivers.\\nI am happy that it feels like and is a Thanos movie, a movie about a giant purple men who is here not because to kill smth but to fullfil his deep inner beliefs which is well written and understandable for the audience.\\nThe level of how well they combined so many important characters in one movie is immeasureable and still have the ability to craft a good story around it.This movie is not perfect. Jokes are sometimes heavily missplaced and Peter Quills occurence with Thanos at Titan is not well thought out. I wish there would be a better solution.Still. 10 years developement of a consistent franchise. And in the end a purple men with a not so empty heart wins. ITS GREAT.I consider myself a big comic book marvel fan. My favorite films from the franchise so far, are Cap. American: Winter Soldier and Thor: Ragnarok. As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations. I am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It\\'s not about power or dominance. It\\'s about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas. I agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can\\'t really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony. I give this movie my highest recommendations. It\\'s a must-see for anyone with just a remote interest in the franchise.This movie is the beginning of the culmination of Marvel\\'s masterfully woven cinematic universe. Beginning back in 2008 with iron man, we are finally seeing the results of all the movies have been pointing to; and it did not disappoint. Thanos is a complex villain, with deeper and more interesting desires than just \"world domination.\" The dilemmas all the characters face in this movie (both the heroes and the villains) are truly thought provoking and leave you on the edge of your seat. No other set of movies has beeen so involved, so expanded, and encompassed so many story lines/characters and previous movies. The sheer amount of star power alone in this film is insane; and they do a masterful job of weaving all these unique and various characters into a common storyline.Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they\\'ve helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel\\'s two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks. And yet, it\\'s perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that\\'s been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible. But that\\'s precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement. Masterfully directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Infinity War is bold, brainy filmmaking at its very best: the kind that will lift your spirits, blow your mind and shatter your soul - occasionally in the same scene. It demonstrates on an epic scale what Marvel has known all along: that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story. For all its blockbuster spectacle (and there\\'s almost too much of that), the film works because it\\'s anchored by the heart, humour and humanity of its characters.The film\\'s basic plot is simple: Thanos (played via motion-capture by Josh Brolin), intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction, has long been on the hunt for the six Infinity Stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe. He dispatches his acolytes to Earth to retrieve the Time Stone, currently in the possession of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and carve the Mind Stone out of the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany). It\\'s a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes we\\'ve come to know and love - from the Avengers to the Guardians of the Galaxy - must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe. From the outset, it\\'s immediately clear that neither the film\\'s directors nor screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are interested in playing it safe. Most other superhero films are bled of high stakes - the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma, but it\\'s a super-safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive. There\\'s no such guarantee here. Within the first ten minutes, we are confronted with the dark, twisted depths to which Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order will sink in order to achieve their goals. Death, as well as genuine loss and sacrifice, is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives Infinity War ever forward, and the film is all the better for it. That\\'s not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience. What\\'s so impressive about Infinity War is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods. When it\\'s funny (and it very often is), it\\'s deeply, truly funny. The film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon, mixing and matching ones you\\'d never have expected to share scenes or trade banter. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is floored by Thor\\'s (Chris Hemsworth) godly muscles. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is charmed by the wit and intelligence of Shuri (Letitia Wright). And it\\'d be impossible to not be utterly delighted by Peter Dinklage\\'s inspired cameo. It\\'s a blithely tongue-in-cheek sensibility shared by Marvel\\'s best comic books, which understand that humour can make you care when it really counts.And, boy, does Infinity War make it count. There are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film: from the charming surrogate father-son dynamic shared by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to the undeniable love that ties Vision and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) together. In many ways, the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love, but to love fiercely and beyond all logic. It\\'s right there when the unfailingly noble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) declares, \"We don\\'t trade lives\", even when giving up one could save billions. There\\'s even a chilling echo of it in Thanos himself. A lesser film would have turned Thanos into a one-dimensional villain, much the way he\\'s all monster and maniac in the comic books. In Infinity War, however, Thanos\\' end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today. There is, as it turns out, method to Thanos\\' madness. It makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), all the more unsettling. For the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle\\'s James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight. Even so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey\\'s film. He plays every note of Tony\\'s reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he\\'s convinced is a suicide mission. He\\'s ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character\\'s most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe.In a film with so many moving parts, some elements don\\'t work quite as well. A couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront - including an original Avenger or two - fade into the background. The film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene, and while most of them are fantastically choreographed, there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent Thanos from clenching his fist. In effect, this is a superhero mêlée that\\'s part over-the-top and part overkill, and might prove too much for those who don\\'t already care for this franchise and the characters in it.Minor quibbles aside, though, Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio\\'s tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It\\'s a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you\\'ll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next.Summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like \"epic\", \"spectacle\", and \"smash\" as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales.\\nThe summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\\nWhen Thanos (Josh Brolin), embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the Infinity Stones, he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path. When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive.\\nWith The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of \"Captain America: Civil War\" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing.\\nNaturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence.\\nWhat really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other.\\nThere are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film.\\nI was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene.\\nBelieve the hype, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be.\\n5 stars out of 5I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please. This movie was 2 1/2 hours long, but I could have sat there another 2 1/2 hours and not noticed. Thoroughly entertaining, and I love how the directors weren\\'t afraid to take chances. I\\'ve read a lot of other user reviews that claim that there\\'s no plot. Unless you\\'re mentally handicapped or not paying attention because you\\'re on your phone the entire movie, the plot is pretty clear, and decent in my opinion.Best movie Avengers infinity war 2018 I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please.

It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians. He interrogates Thor and beats Hulk so bad he is too scared to ever turn green again. A defeated Hulk/Bruce Banner is then transported to Doctor Strange\\'s Sanctum Sanctorum so he can warn him of Thanos\\' arrival. It is down to Doctor Strange, Wong, Tony Stark and Spider Man to prevent Thanos\\' evil minions from destroying New York and taking the time stone. It\\'s a thrilling action sequence that introduces Starks cool new nano-bot armour that creates its own swords and shields. Thanos has been teased since 2012 and the wait has paid off here as he is by far one of the best villains. The story is more about him achieving his goals which is refreshing to see as the villains are normally sidelined in these films. He is so determined to get all six gems, each gem making him stronger. The Avengers and Guardians have to race against time to stop him from finding all six. One sequence on his home planet \\'Titan\\' is worth mentioning and like most of the film, it is breathtaking and tense. His crew (Dark Order) also seem unbeatable as they battle the rest of the Avengers in Wakanda with their alien army which also proves difficult. Thanos gets some interesting backstory, it would have been even better if the menacing Dark Order got some backstory themselves as we never really understand them or their motivations.Even though it enters familiar ground, it is often done differently and most of the time it\\'s unpredictable. It\\'s full of surprises and twists which will leave you exhausted by the end. Although Infinity War feels over stuffed with characters and storylines, the Russo Brothers do an exceptional job by giving each character enough to do. Its great to see some focus on characters like Gamora and Thor as previous films have kept it prominently on characters Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. That\\'s not to say they don\\'t get anything to do because they do, it\\'s just not as much as usual. This entry really does require you to see all of the ones before it as it can become confusing. They often call back to previous events and storylines, so it\\'s a better experience if you are familiar with all of them. There are also so many fun references like Rocket Racoon\\'s need for artificial limbs, Thor\\'s new haircut and Drax\\'s constant quips. There are too many visual effects shots which could have been avoided using practical effects. The CGI shots don\\'t look bad, but sometimes they can be distracting. However it\\'s a technique that is quicker than any other, and with studio films of this scale that\\'s just a small price to pay. The action scenes are so well directed accompanied by a music score by Alan Silvestri who always adds that extra level of excitement to them. It is a relief to say Infinity War runs well over 2 hours 30 minutes which is the longest Marvel film. There is no point saying its \"baggy\" or \"overlong\" as fans of the franchise will greatly appreciate this and with so much going on the runtime is justified.All the reviews that say this movie has no plot are either trolls, idiots, or didn\\'t are to take the time to watch previous marvel movies. Every single one of those ratings and reviews should be taken down and not added to the rating for Infinity War because of their fundamental lack of understanding. It\\'s like coming in and watching the last 2 minutes of an hour long drama show and saying this episode sucks because it has no plot. It\\'s utterly ridiculous!There have been 31 marvel movies leading up to this point. All 31 has have some plot that leads to infinity war. Infinity War IS the end game movie. There is nothing left to explain, nothing left to discuss, it is all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. There have been 31 movies to explain in someway the power of these stones and/or the heroes that come together to fight Thanos in this movie. It\\'s like a long game of chess where Thanos finally makes his move, and it\\'s a huge one.So I beg of any of you who reads this. Don\\'t listen to anyone who says this movie has no plot, has no reason and is only fighting. They aren\\'t worth listening to, Infinity Wars has roughly 60 hours of plot from 31 precious movies leading up to this monumental fight for life or death, and the movie is done to near perfection. The movie is glorious, the CGI is fantastic, the battles are awe-inspiring, and Thanos is made worth of your fear from the very beginning. He is truly the Mad Titan that captures your heart and crushes it right in front of your eyes. Anyone who doesn\\'t think this clearly didn\\'t see the same movie.With the beggining of the movie it was full of surpises. \\nWhat I really liked in the movie was the serious tone and the real threat hanging over the Avengers. Yes...this is THANOS ! He is an amazing villain ! \\nMARVEL Studious show us once again that their production are spectacular visual!I absolutely loved this movie. It was intense, action-packed and emotional. Also delivering comedy when needed, but it was a relatively dark film. All of the actors delivered great performances and the characters continue to be fleshed out and be made human despite the fact that they\\'re superheroes. This is easily the best superhero movie ever made. Thanos is one of the best villains of the MCU, as well as one of the best of Cinematic history in general. Upon first viewing, I hated him, but found his character intriguing. Similar to Emperor Palpatine in the Original and Prequel trilogies of Star Wars. The more times I rewatch it though, I start to understand Thanos\\' point of view more and more. The blurred lines with his motivations make the movie more compelling. Even driving some people to say that Thanos was right in all this. I wouldn\\'t go that far, but I would say his character is misunderstood. Definitely a compelling villain in Thanos. The ending of the movie was insanely emotional, but I love how they (mainly) set aside the original Avengers team to take on Thanos in the fourth Avengers movie. I, for one, cannot wait.That eerie \"Thanos will return\" at the end of the film sent a chill down my spine. It truly is the end game now, and I can\\'t wait to see the Avengers rise up and likely defeat Thanos in the next movie.+Every Hero has their moment to shine (Much like the villain wants, the movie achieves balance in this way)\\n+Good Comedic moments to balance (again pun intended) the dark tone of the film\\n+Emotional and Heavy ending (Seeing Earths Mightiest fail is something devastating to watch)\\n+Complete hype moments that reward you for being a fan of this franchise for 10 years\\n+Incredible performances\\n+Phenomenal original score \\nEtc. Not much you can find that\\'s wrong with this movie. It\\'s literally the perfect movie Marvel has been building up to for 10 years. And those that claim it didn\\'t have an ending as a negative, I beg to differ. Just because the villain won doesn\\'t mean it didn\\'t have an ending. My Rating: 10/10Long behold, the film everyone has been waiting ten years for, is finally here! This is one of those Marvel films that anyone can enjoy, while the Russo Brothers also brilliantly utilizes all that we\\'ve learned in the past MCU films, to create the most cohesive, emotional, and high octane, story yet! The Russo Brothers utilized some of the best tones the MCU has set, to really enhance the emotion and tention in every scene. They put a great deal of heart into this film, but sometimes it got cut thin by the over abundance of jokes, that Marvel seems to think is necessary, every opportunity there is. The Russo Brothers had both hands on the wheel at all times, setting this fast, yet brisk pace, incorporating countless memorable scenes! There wasn\\'t a scene that goes under appreciated, adding in tremendous risk, from the most menacing villain yet, but at times, it can feel a little clunky with the scene placement.With this still being a story-based film, the characters moved the story really well, being the driving force of the film! While having all of these characters on screen at once, it\\'s impossible to balance everyone equally, but the Russo Brothers were able to create so many amazing character moments, to get you really invested into what\\'s going on, and not so much, what they missed. Even though they can step on their own toes at times, creating some inconsistencies and plot gaps, they still did a good job of understanding where these characters come from, and used them to their strengths. The cast as a whole does a great job, displaying seamless chemistry, even from some of the side and new characters.The screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, was very good overall. There are a lot more high points to the writing than bad, but there are still some forceful pieces of dialogue and jokes at times. Markus and McFeely have had their hands in most of these films, creating some hit or miss screenplays, but they put on their best work here.So far, Infinity War undoubtedly has the best action sequences of the saga. The Russo Brothers crafted so many high octane action scenes, backed up by some amazing stunt work. The effects were done pretty well for the most part, but there are some points where you can tell they got lazy, and didn\\'t completely polish things up as well as they could\\'ve.Overall, Infinity War is THE BEST film of the Infinity Saga, bringing these films to new heights!Infinity War had a lot to offer with stunning cgi that basically made the entire film apart from the heroes heads animated but done so well it looks real. The adventure the quest the ultimate event, and over ten years of waiting for the MCU to finish. Thanos really makes you question your morals... if you\\'re twelve years old and don\\'t understand the myth of overpopulation and genocidal tactics. The action and heros are a welcome inclusion and yeah this movie was kicka**. Not as good as Endgame but close.By far the best marvel film, it is so good. The most emotional marvel film to date. The battle is the best part and the parts after the battle are very emotional and after 1st time watching you really want to know what\\'s going to happen and gets you thinking a lot. The acting is solid, visual effects are great, definitely a 10/10 especially for a marvel film.A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level.\\nIn a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second.\\nIt is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop.\\n\\'Avengers Infinity War\\' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.10 Years of Build Up wasn\\'t wasted on this Movie. Infinity War is one of the greatest movies of all time because of how carefully they set everything else up. Stellar character growth and an incredible story make this stand out amongst the rest of Marvel. Thanos is one of the Greatest Movie Villains of all time due to the handling of his character. Everything from the beginning filled with dread of what\\'s To come to the ending where they fulfilled their promise of dread was done perfectly. Infinity War is one of the best action movies ever made.I believe that Avengers : Infinity War is without a doubt the pinnacle of blockbuster entertainment (along with its sequel). Nothing quite like it has been attempted before ; and it may take a while for anything to surpass that.To this date, it is my favorite theater experience of all time. I watched it opening weekend, managed to avoid all the spoilers and contained my excitement as best as I could in the previous days. Then, the movie made me laugh, sent chills down my spine and left me shocked by the time the credits rolled. It might not be the most creative or artistic movie out there, but there is no doubt to me that it\\'s one of the most entertaining. There is not a second of downtime during its two hours-and-a-half. Every character is given its time to shine. It is simply A-W-E-S-O-M-E.Personally, I have to agree with Martin Scorsese when it comes to Infinity War. You simply can\\'t call this thing a movie.In reality, it is much more than that.I would call it a cultural phenomenon.Avengers Infinity War is a truly great film. The actors pour their hearts out into every scene and the story is brilliant bringing lots of great twists and turns! The cinematography in this movie is beautiful making it visually stunning. The characters are also very interesting and you care about most of them. I recommend this Avengers film.Easily the best Avengers film to date. It is refreshing to see our heroes lose for once. Who knew that Marvel would actually put real stakes for the Avengers to deal with into one of their films?If I may blatantly objectify someone for a moment, bearded Chris Evans is the best Chris Evans :-)I have to say that the \"I don\\'t want to go!\" scene between Peter and Tony got me right in the feels.Thanos is the most powerful, he always defeats all the heroes, (but they always like his action) and we only see (thanos is in wakanda and killing Vision).\\nIt will be that the stones are entangled in various scenarios; that they are not well, by the power of thanos (when it was the snap), and that the heroes solve the revenge.Avengers infinity war is a masterpiece in every way with an amazing story that is never boring, phenomenal action that\\'s intense but also a lot of fun, amazing acting (stand outs are Robert Downey jr, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pratt, and josh brolin), fantastic visuals, lovable and interesting characters, a great villain with thanos, hilarious comedy, gut wrenching moments, and a shocking ending. Watch it immediately.Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E\\'s that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. \\nSo let\\'s start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it\\'s highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). \\nNow, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you\\'ve seen in the previous marvel movies that aren\\'t dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it\\'s the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. \\nAnd of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel\\'s villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he\\'s got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. \\nI cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you\\'re a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what\\'s to come. I may be bias once again but I just have to. I have to rate this movie 10/10. If I don\\'t, I would be betraying myself.I went and looked, and I want to express my thoughts.I went to this film with very high expectations, with a sense of something. I went to him twice, the first time, myself, and the second with the family, and I was even surprised that my mother, sister and dad (who do not understand this movie at all) brought unreal pleasure and an ocean of emotions.Each frame, each scene does not let you get bored, from the Marvel logo, and to the stage after the credits. Favorite heroes once again experienced side by side and you feel it, you are completely absorbed in a hurricane of events and you are watching it in one breath. In comparison with the War of Infinity, even the Confrontation looks like an ordinary fight in the sandbox.Uuuu, and the villain, the best as for me the best in this kirovoveselennoy, he is not just a bot at once, without motivation, no, it\\'s just the opposite. I liked Thanos so much that you do not want to, and he began to impress me, in terms of his convictions (I had it only once, with Joker Heath Ledger). He has feelings, he makes choices, he\\'s alive.Tense scenes are beautiful, in one moment I still let off a meager male tear (and this happens to me very, very rarely). What about the humor, the jokes are correct for me, and they do not bother you like Thor: Ragnarok, although in the beginning they look a little tight. Well, the action, it is very high-quality, and in comparison with the Black Panther is generally ideal.And of course the film can not be without punctures. The lack of predictability of some story lines, and a couple of moments that were very predictable, but they are fade against the background of all this scale.Yes, you will not find anything in this film about something, something, but, what, what, what, steep humor. Thanks to Marvel and of course the Rousseau brothers, the beautiful actors and the wonderful movie that I\\'ve been waiting for for 3 years.Out of 10, I give the War of Infinity 9.This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists.

Dont get me wrong endgame is good but to say its the best marvel film is jus marvel fan boys being stupid.\\nI just dont see how people are saying endgame is the best marvel film when theres clearly other marvel films better than it!\\nBut trust me this is the film that changed the mcu , lol maybe it because i wanted them to lose because thanos is badass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..but still 10/10. Or 9.5 if its possible.The MCU has been very consistent in their filmmaking and I am happy that Infinity War absolutely delivers.\\nI am happy that it feels like and is a Thanos movie, a movie about a giant purple men who is here not because to kill smth but to fullfil his deep inner beliefs which is well written and understandable for the audience.\\nThe level of how well they combined so many important characters in one movie is immeasureable and still have the ability to craft a good story around it.This movie is not perfect. Jokes are sometimes heavily missplaced and Peter Quills occurence with Thanos at Titan is not well thought out. I wish there would be a better solution.Still. 10 years developement of a consistent franchise. And in the end a purple men with a not so empty heart wins. ITS GREAT.I consider myself a big comic book marvel fan. My favorite films from the franchise so far, are Cap. American: Winter Soldier and Thor: Ragnarok. As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations. I am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It\\'s not about power or dominance. It\\'s about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas. I agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can\\'t really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony. I give this movie my highest recommendations. It\\'s a must-see for anyone with just a remote interest in the franchise.This movie is the beginning of the culmination of Marvel\\'s masterfully woven cinematic universe. Beginning back in 2008 with iron man, we are finally seeing the results of all the movies have been pointing to; and it did not disappoint. Thanos is a complex villain, with deeper and more interesting desires than just \"world domination.\" The dilemmas all the characters face in this movie (both the heroes and the villains) are truly thought provoking and leave you on the edge of your seat. No other set of movies has beeen so involved, so expanded, and encompassed so many story lines/characters and previous movies. The sheer amount of star power alone in this film is insane; and they do a masterful job of weaving all these unique and various characters into a common storyline.Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they\\'ve helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel\\'s two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks. And yet, it\\'s perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that\\'s been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible. But that\\'s precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement. Masterfully directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Infinity War is bold, brainy filmmaking at its very best: the kind that will lift your spirits, blow your mind and shatter your soul - occasionally in the same scene. It demonstrates on an epic scale what Marvel has known all along: that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story. For all its blockbuster spectacle (and there\\'s almost too much of that), the film works because it\\'s anchored by the heart, humour and humanity of its characters.The film\\'s basic plot is simple: Thanos (played via motion-capture by Josh Brolin), intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction, has long been on the hunt for the six Infinity Stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe. He dispatches his acolytes to Earth to retrieve the Time Stone, currently in the possession of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and carve the Mind Stone out of the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany). It\\'s a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes we\\'ve come to know and love - from the Avengers to the Guardians of the Galaxy - must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe. From the outset, it\\'s immediately clear that neither the film\\'s directors nor screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are interested in playing it safe. Most other superhero films are bled of high stakes - the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma, but it\\'s a super-safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive. There\\'s no such guarantee here. Within the first ten minutes, we are confronted with the dark, twisted depths to which Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order will sink in order to achieve their goals. Death, as well as genuine loss and sacrifice, is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives Infinity War ever forward, and the film is all the better for it. That\\'s not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience. What\\'s so impressive about Infinity War is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods. When it\\'s funny (and it very often is), it\\'s deeply, truly funny. The film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon, mixing and matching ones you\\'d never have expected to share scenes or trade banter. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is floored by Thor\\'s (Chris Hemsworth) godly muscles. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is charmed by the wit and intelligence of Shuri (Letitia Wright). And it\\'d be impossible to not be utterly delighted by Peter Dinklage\\'s inspired cameo. It\\'s a blithely tongue-in-cheek sensibility shared by Marvel\\'s best comic books, which understand that humour can make you care when it really counts.And, boy, does Infinity War make it count. There are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film: from the charming surrogate father-son dynamic shared by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to the undeniable love that ties Vision and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) together. In many ways, the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love, but to love fiercely and beyond all logic. It\\'s right there when the unfailingly noble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) declares, \"We don\\'t trade lives\", even when giving up one could save billions. There\\'s even a chilling echo of it in Thanos himself. A lesser film would have turned Thanos into a one-dimensional villain, much the way he\\'s all monster and maniac in the comic books. In Infinity War, however, Thanos\\' end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today. There is, as it turns out, method to Thanos\\' madness. It makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), all the more unsettling. For the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle\\'s James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight. Even so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey\\'s film. He plays every note of Tony\\'s reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he\\'s convinced is a suicide mission. He\\'s ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character\\'s most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe.In a film with so many moving parts, some elements don\\'t work quite as well. A couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront - including an original Avenger or two - fade into the background. The film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene, and while most of them are fantastically choreographed, there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent Thanos from clenching his fist. In effect, this is a superhero mêlée that\\'s part over-the-top and part overkill, and might prove too much for those who don\\'t already care for this franchise and the characters in it.Minor quibbles aside, though, Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio\\'s tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It\\'s a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you\\'ll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next.Summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like \"epic\", \"spectacle\", and \"smash\" as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales.\\nThe summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\\nWhen Thanos (Josh Brolin), embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the Infinity Stones, he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path. When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive.\\nWith The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of \"Captain America: Civil War\" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing.\\nNaturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence.\\nWhat really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other.\\nThere are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film.\\nI was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene.\\nBelieve the hype, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be.\\n5 stars out of 5I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please. This movie was 2 1/2 hours long, but I could have sat there another 2 1/2 hours and not noticed. Thoroughly entertaining, and I love how the directors weren\\'t afraid to take chances. I\\'ve read a lot of other user reviews that claim that there\\'s no plot. Unless you\\'re mentally handicapped or not paying attention because you\\'re on your phone the entire movie, the plot is pretty clear, and decent in my opinion.Best movie Avengers infinity war 2018 I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please.

It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians. He interrogates Thor and beats Hulk so bad he is too scared to ever turn green again. A defeated Hulk/Bruce Banner is then transported to Doctor Strange\\'s Sanctum Sanctorum so he can warn him of Thanos\\' arrival. It is down to Doctor Strange, Wong, Tony Stark and Spider Man to prevent Thanos\\' evil minions from destroying New York and taking the time stone. It\\'s a thrilling action sequence that introduces Starks cool new nano-bot armour that creates its own swords and shields. Thanos has been teased since 2012 and the wait has paid off here as he is by far one of the best villains. The story is more about him achieving his goals which is refreshing to see as the villains are normally sidelined in these films. He is so determined to get all six gems, each gem making him stronger. The Avengers and Guardians have to race against time to stop him from finding all six. One sequence on his home planet \\'Titan\\' is worth mentioning and like most of the film, it is breathtaking and tense. His crew (Dark Order) also seem unbeatable as they battle the rest of the Avengers in Wakanda with their alien army which also proves difficult. Thanos gets some interesting backstory, it would have been even better if the menacing Dark Order got some backstory themselves as we never really understand them or their motivations.Even though it enters familiar ground, it is often done differently and most of the time it\\'s unpredictable. It\\'s full of surprises and twists which will leave you exhausted by the end. Although Infinity War feels over stuffed with characters and storylines, the Russo Brothers do an exceptional job by giving each character enough to do. Its great to see some focus on characters like Gamora and Thor as previous films have kept it prominently on characters Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. That\\'s not to say they don\\'t get anything to do because they do, it\\'s just not as much as usual. This entry really does require you to see all of the ones before it as it can become confusing. They often call back to previous events and storylines, so it\\'s a better experience if you are familiar with all of them. There are also so many fun references like Rocket Racoon\\'s need for artificial limbs, Thor\\'s new haircut and Drax\\'s constant quips. There are too many visual effects shots which could have been avoided using practical effects. The CGI shots don\\'t look bad, but sometimes they can be distracting. However it\\'s a technique that is quicker than any other, and with studio films of this scale that\\'s just a small price to pay. The action scenes are so well directed accompanied by a music score by Alan Silvestri who always adds that extra level of excitement to them. It is a relief to say Infinity War runs well over 2 hours 30 minutes which is the longest Marvel film. There is no point saying its \"baggy\" or \"overlong\" as fans of the franchise will greatly appreciate this and with so much going on the runtime is justified.All the reviews that say this movie has no plot are either trolls, idiots, or didn\\'t are to take the time to watch previous marvel movies. Every single one of those ratings and reviews should be taken down and not added to the rating for Infinity War because of their fundamental lack of understanding. It\\'s like coming in and watching the last 2 minutes of an hour long drama show and saying this episode sucks because it has no plot. It\\'s utterly ridiculous!There have been 31 marvel movies leading up to this point. All 31 has have some plot that leads to infinity war. Infinity War IS the end game movie. There is nothing left to explain, nothing left to discuss, it is all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. There have been 31 movies to explain in someway the power of these stones and/or the heroes that come together to fight Thanos in this movie. It\\'s like a long game of chess where Thanos finally makes his move, and it\\'s a huge one.So I beg of any of you who reads this. Don\\'t listen to anyone who says this movie has no plot, has no reason and is only fighting. They aren\\'t worth listening to, Infinity Wars has roughly 60 hours of plot from 31 precious movies leading up to this monumental fight for life or death, and the movie is done to near perfection. The movie is glorious, the CGI is fantastic, the battles are awe-inspiring, and Thanos is made worth of your fear from the very beginning. He is truly the Mad Titan that captures your heart and crushes it right in front of your eyes. Anyone who doesn\\'t think this clearly didn\\'t see the same movie.With the beggining of the movie it was full of surpises. \\nWhat I really liked in the movie was the serious tone and the real threat hanging over the Avengers. Yes...this is THANOS ! He is an amazing villain ! \\nMARVEL Studious show us once again that their production are spectacular visual!I absolutely loved this movie. It was intense, action-packed and emotional. Also delivering comedy when needed, but it was a relatively dark film. All of the actors delivered great performances and the characters continue to be fleshed out and be made human despite the fact that they\\'re superheroes. This is easily the best superhero movie ever made. Thanos is one of the best villains of the MCU, as well as one of the best of Cinematic history in general. Upon first viewing, I hated him, but found his character intriguing. Similar to Emperor Palpatine in the Original and Prequel trilogies of Star Wars. The more times I rewatch it though, I start to understand Thanos\\' point of view more and more. The blurred lines with his motivations make the movie more compelling. Even driving some people to say that Thanos was right in all this. I wouldn\\'t go that far, but I would say his character is misunderstood. Definitely a compelling villain in Thanos. The ending of the movie was insanely emotional, but I love how they (mainly) set aside the original Avengers team to take on Thanos in the fourth Avengers movie. I, for one, cannot wait.That eerie \"Thanos will return\" at the end of the film sent a chill down my spine. It truly is the end game now, and I can\\'t wait to see the Avengers rise up and likely defeat Thanos in the next movie.+Every Hero has their moment to shine (Much like the villain wants, the movie achieves balance in this way)\\n+Good Comedic moments to balance (again pun intended) the dark tone of the film\\n+Emotional and Heavy ending (Seeing Earths Mightiest fail is something devastating to watch)\\n+Complete hype moments that reward you for being a fan of this franchise for 10 years\\n+Incredible performances\\n+Phenomenal original score \\nEtc. Not much you can find that\\'s wrong with this movie. It\\'s literally the perfect movie Marvel has been building up to for 10 years. And those that claim it didn\\'t have an ending as a negative, I beg to differ. Just because the villain won doesn\\'t mean it didn\\'t have an ending. My Rating: 10/10Long behold, the film everyone has been waiting ten years for, is finally here! This is one of those Marvel films that anyone can enjoy, while the Russo Brothers also brilliantly utilizes all that we\\'ve learned in the past MCU films, to create the most cohesive, emotional, and high octane, story yet! The Russo Brothers utilized some of the best tones the MCU has set, to really enhance the emotion and tention in every scene. They put a great deal of heart into this film, but sometimes it got cut thin by the over abundance of jokes, that Marvel seems to think is necessary, every opportunity there is. The Russo Brothers had both hands on the wheel at all times, setting this fast, yet brisk pace, incorporating countless memorable scenes! There wasn\\'t a scene that goes under appreciated, adding in tremendous risk, from the most menacing villain yet, but at times, it can feel a little clunky with the scene placement.With this still being a story-based film, the characters moved the story really well, being the driving force of the film! While having all of these characters on screen at once, it\\'s impossible to balance everyone equally, but the Russo Brothers were able to create so many amazing character moments, to get you really invested into what\\'s going on, and not so much, what they missed. Even though they can step on their own toes at times, creating some inconsistencies and plot gaps, they still did a good job of understanding where these characters come from, and used them to their strengths. The cast as a whole does a great job, displaying seamless chemistry, even from some of the side and new characters.The screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, was very good overall. There are a lot more high points to the writing than bad, but there are still some forceful pieces of dialogue and jokes at times. Markus and McFeely have had their hands in most of these films, creating some hit or miss screenplays, but they put on their best work here.So far, Infinity War undoubtedly has the best action sequences of the saga. The Russo Brothers crafted so many high octane action scenes, backed up by some amazing stunt work. The effects were done pretty well for the most part, but there are some points where you can tell they got lazy, and didn\\'t completely polish things up as well as they could\\'ve.Overall, Infinity War is THE BEST film of the Infinity Saga, bringing these films to new heights!Infinity War had a lot to offer with stunning cgi that basically made the entire film apart from the heroes heads animated but done so well it looks real. The adventure the quest the ultimate event, and over ten years of waiting for the MCU to finish. Thanos really makes you question your morals... if you\\'re twelve years old and don\\'t understand the myth of overpopulation and genocidal tactics. The action and heros are a welcome inclusion and yeah this movie was kicka**. Not as good as Endgame but close.By far the best marvel film, it is so good. The most emotional marvel film to date. The battle is the best part and the parts after the battle are very emotional and after 1st time watching you really want to know what\\'s going to happen and gets you thinking a lot. The acting is solid, visual effects are great, definitely a 10/10 especially for a marvel film.A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level.\\nIn a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second.\\nIt is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop.\\n\\'Avengers Infinity War\\' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.10 Years of Build Up wasn\\'t wasted on this Movie. Infinity War is one of the greatest movies of all time because of how carefully they set everything else up. Stellar character growth and an incredible story make this stand out amongst the rest of Marvel. Thanos is one of the Greatest Movie Villains of all time due to the handling of his character. Everything from the beginning filled with dread of what\\'s To come to the ending where they fulfilled their promise of dread was done perfectly. Infinity War is one of the best action movies ever made.I believe that Avengers : Infinity War is without a doubt the pinnacle of blockbuster entertainment (along with its sequel). Nothing quite like it has been attempted before ; and it may take a while for anything to surpass that.To this date, it is my favorite theater experience of all time. I watched it opening weekend, managed to avoid all the spoilers and contained my excitement as best as I could in the previous days. Then, the movie made me laugh, sent chills down my spine and left me shocked by the time the credits rolled. It might not be the most creative or artistic movie out there, but there is no doubt to me that it\\'s one of the most entertaining. There is not a second of downtime during its two hours-and-a-half. Every character is given its time to shine. It is simply A-W-E-S-O-M-E.Personally, I have to agree with Martin Scorsese when it comes to Infinity War. You simply can\\'t call this thing a movie.In reality, it is much more than that.I would call it a cultural phenomenon.Avengers Infinity War is a truly great film. The actors pour their hearts out into every scene and the story is brilliant bringing lots of great twists and turns! The cinematography in this movie is beautiful making it visually stunning. The characters are also very interesting and you care about most of them. I recommend this Avengers film.Easily the best Avengers film to date. It is refreshing to see our heroes lose for once. Who knew that Marvel would actually put real stakes for the Avengers to deal with into one of their films?If I may blatantly objectify someone for a moment, bearded Chris Evans is the best Chris Evans :-)I have to say that the \"I don\\'t want to go!\" scene between Peter and Tony got me right in the feels.Thanos is the most powerful, he always defeats all the heroes, (but they always like his action) and we only see (thanos is in wakanda and killing Vision).\\nIt will be that the stones are entangled in various scenarios; that they are not well, by the power of thanos (when it was the snap), and that the heroes solve the revenge.Avengers infinity war is a masterpiece in every way with an amazing story that is never boring, phenomenal action that\\'s intense but also a lot of fun, amazing acting (stand outs are Robert Downey jr, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pratt, and josh brolin), fantastic visuals, lovable and interesting characters, a great villain with thanos, hilarious comedy, gut wrenching moments, and a shocking ending. Watch it immediately.Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E\\'s that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. \\nSo let\\'s start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it\\'s highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). \\nNow, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you\\'ve seen in the previous marvel movies that aren\\'t dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it\\'s the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. \\nAnd of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel\\'s villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he\\'s got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. \\nI cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you\\'re a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what\\'s to come. I may be bias once again but I just have to. I have to rate this movie 10/10. If I don\\'t, I would be betraying myself.I went and looked, and I want to express my thoughts.I went to this film with very high expectations, with a sense of something. I went to him twice, the first time, myself, and the second with the family, and I was even surprised that my mother, sister and dad (who do not understand this movie at all) brought unreal pleasure and an ocean of emotions.Each frame, each scene does not let you get bored, from the Marvel logo, and to the stage after the credits. Favorite heroes once again experienced side by side and you feel it, you are completely absorbed in a hurricane of events and you are watching it in one breath. In comparison with the War of Infinity, even the Confrontation looks like an ordinary fight in the sandbox.Uuuu, and the villain, the best as for me the best in this kirovoveselennoy, he is not just a bot at once, without motivation, no, it\\'s just the opposite. I liked Thanos so much that you do not want to, and he began to impress me, in terms of his convictions (I had it only once, with Joker Heath Ledger). He has feelings, he makes choices, he\\'s alive.Tense scenes are beautiful, in one moment I still let off a meager male tear (and this happens to me very, very rarely). What about the humor, the jokes are correct for me, and they do not bother you like Thor: Ragnarok, although in the beginning they look a little tight. Well, the action, it is very high-quality, and in comparison with the Black Panther is generally ideal.And of course the film can not be without punctures. The lack of predictability of some story lines, and a couple of moments that were very predictable, but they are fade against the background of all this scale.Yes, you will not find anything in this film about something, something, but, what, what, what, steep humor. Thanks to Marvel and of course the Rousseau brothers, the beautiful actors and the wonderful movie that I\\'ve been waiting for for 3 years.Out of 10, I give the War of Infinity 9.'"
